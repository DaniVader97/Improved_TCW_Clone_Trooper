# DaniVader97's Clone Trooper model file repository
I've made this base for you people with every needed DMX. QC. VTF. VMT. files and other archives to make your own posable clone trooper models for Garry's Mod and Source Filmmaker without any need to unpack or decompile the addons if you want to make hexes o re-skins, with this you can make your own clone trooper units, squads, legions, batallions and etc or individual clone characters.

# How do I work with this bunch of files?
This IS MEANT for experienced users knowledgable on Source Engine's model compiling and editing hijinks. You need Crowbar, Blender, Blender Source Tools, VTFEdit and GIMP (because it's free and still as good as Photoshop) to work with all of this. You can get the needed programs from these links: https://www.blender.org/ http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/ https://github.com/ZeqMacaw/Crowbar https://github.com/NeilJed/VTFLib https://www.gimp.org/

And if you are knowledgable in GitHub too and you want to make some additions/modifications you can request a fork with your own modifications, just let me know. Will you?

# Consider this as some kind of Terms of Service/License...
While you can use these files to make your own posable clones, keep in mind that you can't claim this file repository as yours: you must credit me for using this database to make and upload your clone trooper models to Gmod or SFM workshops. Also it would be very nice to  credit properly these names too:

suno (https://steamcommunity.com/id/sunotw), Helios/Vaqxai (https://steamcommunity.com/id/vaqxai), ThaHerminatar (https://steamcommunity.com/id/thaherminatar), Fxo (https://steamcommunity.com/id/OfficialFxo), thechrist (https://steamcommunity.com/id/thecrhist), Florian (https://steamcommunity.com/id/florianboy), ArveFraPakistan/Sample (https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198185197806), Lobby_Bandit/Bandit (https://steamcommunity.com/id/lobby_bandit), AussiWozzi (https://steamcommunity.com/id/AussiWozzi), Tessa Kitty/123 (https://steamcommunity.com/id/OneMommyTooMany), Preditor/Fedbread (https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059782417), NotSWorthy (https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198125758643), MIBALongshot (https://steamcommunity.com/id/MIBAMYNIBBA), Gideon/MDG (https://steamcommunity.com/id/MyDudeGideon/), Kyle/CoBud91 (https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZeroNingens), Garith and Budds 

Because all of these people are the original creators who made these assets I picked and modified from their original works, just for creating this improved clone trooper model and base, asking always for permission first before doing anything and promising to credit them. Please keep suporting them and the good stuff they do!

And finally, under no circumstances should you use this for any type of economical profit or commercial stuff because of Disney and Lucasfilm: this is meant and solely aimed for making Source Engine models suited for fanarts like animations and sceneposing, so as long as you use the contents of this repository for fan made stuff there will be no problems.
