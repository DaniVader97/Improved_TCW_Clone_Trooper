# Improved_TCW_Clone_Trooper
Here's a repository for you people with every needed DMX. QC. VTF. and VMT. files to make your own posable clone trooper models.

# How do I work with this bunch of files?
This IS MEANT for experienced users knowledgable on Source Engine's model compiling and editing hijinks. You need Crowbar, Blender, Blender Source Tools, VTFEdit and GIMP (because it's free and still as good as Photoshop) to work with all of this. You can get the needed programs on these links: https://www.blender.org/ http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/ https://github.com/ZeqMacaw/Crowbar https://github.com/NeilJed/VTFLib https://www.gimp.org/
