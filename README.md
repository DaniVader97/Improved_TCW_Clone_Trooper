# DaniVader97's Clone Trooper model file repository
I've made this base for you people with every needed DMX. QC. VTF. and VMT. files to make your own posable clone trooper models for Garry's Mod and Source Filmmaker.

# How do I work with this bunch of files?
This IS MEANT for experienced users knowledgable on Source Engine's model compiling and editing hijinks. You need Crowbar, Blender, Blender Source Tools, VTFEdit and GIMP (because it's free and still as good as Photoshop) to work with all of this. You can get the needed programs from these links: https://www.blender.org/ http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/ https://github.com/ZeqMacaw/Crowbar https://github.com/NeilJed/VTFLib https://www.gimp.org/

# Consider this as some kind of Terms of Service...
While you can use these files to make your own posable clones, keep in mind that you can't claim the stuff as yours: you have to credit me for using this database to make and upload your clone trooper models to Gmod and SFM workshops, also it would be an act of good faith to give credit to the original creators too for these modified assets because I just picked many things with their permission to create the model addon and this base.
